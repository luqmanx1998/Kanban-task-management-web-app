📈 Challenges I Faced
Responsive Fixed Navbar:
Adjusting the fixed navbar to account for the sidebar dynamically without causing layout shifts or scroll gaps.

Drag and Drop Logic:
Implementing seamless drag-and-drop with dnd-kit was tricky, especially handling reordering inside columns and moving tasks between different columns.

State Persistence:
Setting up localStorage manually to persist Redux state was a new experience and required careful syncing between in-memory state and browser storage.

Balancing Refactoring vs Shipping:
I had to consciously limit over-refactoring and "perfecting" the app to actually finish and ship it, which was a valuable lesson in prioritizing delivery over endless polishing.

✨ What I'd Improve with More Time
More modular reusable components (e.g., Modal component, Button component)

More robust localStorage syncing (e.g., debounce writes to localStorage)

Possibly introduce a backend for user accounts and cloud persistence

✅ Status
Completed and Deployed
(Deployed link will go here after deployment!)

🧠 Final Thoughts
This project pushed me in terms of advanced React patterns, Redux, drag-and-drop UX, and production-level polish.
It is one of my portfolio pieces showing my ability to build real-world, scalable applications.
